Some pseudocode-esque logic and/or context

Disadvantaged, as defined by the Climate and Economic Justice Map thingy along with SVI and ADI? Maybe? is including the SVI and ADI measurements necessary? Eh yes and no? bc the C&E justice map uses Census Tracts, whereas SVI and ADI uses Census Blocks. And Census Blocks are a little more pain in the ass to deal with.

I guess what we display in terms of SDOH / HRSN / health trends things or whatever, we display them to client iff the "yes" threshold is met
